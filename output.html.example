   <TD>Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic <b>factions</b> have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability.<br> To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the <b>factions</b> in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.<br> to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring <b>factions</b> that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.</TD>

   <TD>When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the <b>international</b> financial system.<br> Some of the worst actors on the <b>international</b> stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.<br> Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of <b>international</b> terrorism.</TD>
